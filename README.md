Titanic Survival Prediction
Project Overview
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning models. We developed and compared two models: a simple neural network and a neural network enhanced with optimization techniques. The goal was to explore how different machine learning strategies and optimization techniques affect model performance, specifically in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
