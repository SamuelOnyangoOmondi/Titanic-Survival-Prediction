Titanic Survival Prediction Project
Overview
This project focuses on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic, utilizing machine learning models. We aim to apply and compare different modeling techniques, including a simple neural network model and an optimized neural network model, to understand the impact of various optimization strategies on model performance.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is derived from the Titanic machine learning competition on Kaggle. It comprises passenger data such as age, sex, ticket class, and survival status, making it highly relevant to our classification task. Each feature in the dataset directly contributes to model training and prediction, closely aligning with the project's objectives.

Model Implementation
We implemented two distinct models for this project:

Model 1 (Simple Neural Network): A baseline model without any optimization techniques, designed to establish a performance benchmark.
Model 2 (Optimized Neural Network): An advanced model incorporating at least three optimization techniques aimed at improving performance.
Both models are saved in the saved_models directory, ensuring reproducibility and further experimentation.

Optimization Techniques
For Model 2, we applied several optimization techniques, including:

Learning Rate Scheduling: Adjusts the learning rate throughout training to find the optimal learning rate more effectively.
Early Stopping: Monitors validation loss to halt training when improvement ceases, preventing overfitting.
Dropout: Randomly omits a subset of features at each iteration to reduce overfitting and promote generalization.
Each optimization technique was selected for its potential to enhance model performance, and parameters were carefully tuned based on empirical evidence and best practices in the field.

Error Analysis
We conducted a comprehensive error analysis to evaluate and compare the models' performance. This included:

Confusion Matrix: Offers insights into the types of errors made by the models.
F1 Score: Balances precision and recall, providing a single metric to assess model performance.
The error analysis outcomes are well-documented and easy to interpret, facilitating a deeper understanding of each model's strengths and weaknesses.

Model Performance
The performance of our models was rigorously evaluated on validation and test datasets. Model 1 served as a baseline, demonstrating solid performance. Model 2, with its optimization techniques, aimed to surpass this baseline by a significant margin. The detailed performance metrics, including accuracy and F1 scores, underscore the effectiveness of our optimization strategies.

Conclusion
This project illustrates the power of neural networks and the impact of optimization techniques on model performance. Through careful dataset alignment, model implementation, and error analysis, we have developed models that not only predict Titanic passengers' survival with high accuracy but also highlight the potential for machine learning in historical data analysis.
